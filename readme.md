CS 601 Web Application Development 
Assignment 3 - Megha Samala

This assignment features a portfolio styled with CSS Grid and Flexbox and advanced CSS such as pseudo-classes, combinators, and more to 
create a responsive webpage. The portfolio has a header with a navbar (currently unresponsive), footer, sidebar with personal and contact information/links, and projects with deployment or repo links, descriptions, and pictures.

The styling for this page features a header and footer styled with Flexbox, a main section featuring a sidebar and projects styled with nested Grids, and media queries to change the layout of the grids on devices of different sizes. The :hover and :active pseudo-classes are used for interactivity on links, while the :first-child and :last-child pseudo-classes are used for specific element styling on the projects divs, along with the > child combinator and the [href^="#"] attribute selector to style internal links. The ::before and ::after pseudo-elements are used to add content to the h1 and footer link elements without altering the HTML.

References used to create code are delineated in comments above the respective code chunks.
All CSS and HTML has been validated using the websites provided in the assignment instructions.

I asked about if external fonts/icons were allowed in the group discussion board, but I forgot to follow up - please feel free to deduct points/let me know if they are not allowed.
